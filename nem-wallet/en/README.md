An NEM wallet chrome extension.
By using this app, you can send & receive XEM so easily.
All transactions are signed on your local, so it NEVER sends your privateKey to the network. Hence it's secure!


## Main features

- Simple XEM Sending
- XEM Market Rate & Chart
- Detailed Transactions View 
- Addressbook
- Keypair Generator


## Secure!

This wallet keeps your privateKey secure.
All tx are signed locally before you broadcast them, so NEVER sends your privateKey to the network.
Your privateKey is encrypted by an arbitrary passphrase that decided by yourself, then saved on your local disk safely. Of course, you can also remove it easily from your local disk if you want to.


## FAQ

> Where is my private key stored?

Your privateKey is encrypted by your passphrase which is decided by yourself at first boot, then saved on localStorage of Chrome browser. So it is secure. Of course, you can also remove it from local easily whenever you want.

> Oops! I've entered incorrect passphrase!

If you have entered incorrect passphrase on the entrance screen, your encrypted privateKey on your local disk is removed for a security reason. However you can restore your wallet to set your privateKey again on th settings menu if you know your privateKey yet.

> I've forgotten my secret seed...

Unfortunately, that is The END as usual with other cryptocurrencies. Just in case we recommend you save your privateKey as a screenshot image or a paper wallet on the safety place like a USB memory or your real wallet.
