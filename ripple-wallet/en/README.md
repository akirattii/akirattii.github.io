## FAQ

> What is TestNet?

'TestNet' is an alternative network which is used for testing. Therefore XRP on TestNet is valueless for you. Now the default network's setting of this wallet app is **TestNet**. So please change the network setting on the settings page to **LiveNet** before you use it on real purpose.

> Where is my private key stored?

Your private key is encrypted by your passphrase then saved on localStorage of Chrome browser, so it is secure. Of course, you can also remove it from local whenever you want.

> Oops! I've entered incorrect passphrase!

If you have entered incorrect passphrase on the entrance screen, your encrypted secret seed on your local disk is removed for a security reason. However you can restore your wallet to set your secret seed again on th settings menu if you know your secret seed yet.

> I've forgotten my secret seed...

Unfortunately, that is The END as usual with other cryptocurrencies. Just in case we recommend you save your secret seed as a screenshot image or a paper wallet on the safety place like a USB memory or your real wallet.

> Open source?

Yes. This wallet is a Chrome extension, which is *actually* open source software because you can read its source code whenever you want by *DevTool* the built-in debugger of Chrome browser. By use it, you can also watch the network use of this wallet by it. You can believe this wallet by auditing its code by yourself. It is definitely an open source software but keep in mind that its copyright is still owned by me.
